### Gameplay
MazerLazer is a top down 2D racing maze game set against the backdrop of outer space. Two players race against each other through a maze, collecting and using power ups to alter the maze as they race to be the first one to exit. 
* Each round the maze creates a new unique layout (powerup location and maze pathways). 
* After 15 seconds, the layout changes the exit location as well as removing some walls, but leaving player built walls intact.
